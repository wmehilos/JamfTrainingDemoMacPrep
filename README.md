# Jamf Training Demo Mac Prep

## Purpose
This repo houses the scripts I use to prepare my Jamf Training Demo Mac for buildup/teardown before or after a week's course. While the scripts and things here will probably have limited utility outside of my particular use case, I hope that someone might find this workflow inspiring, interesting, or insightful.

## Notes
Just getting things setup right now for testing, more to come soon.
